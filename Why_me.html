      <div class = "value"><p><span>W</span>hat is life but the transfer of emotion? The transer of energy, and ideas? How effectively do we communicate these energies and ideas on a day to day basis? By building websites I find it is one of the more rewarding ways to deliver your message to your audience. At the click of a button, you can reach 5,000 people, and with just the right visuals and respresentation, you can touch 5,000 people.</p></div>

     Can you guess which country that is? Well, if you can't, i'll just tell you. It is the Dominican Republic. It should deffitnely be one of the places on your travel list, if you want to have a good vacation! For starters there is an abundance of  tourist attractions, most of their retail is relatively cheap, and well, why not?
